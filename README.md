     Web Development Project Report
Project Title: SecureDocShare - Secure Document Sharing Platform
Developer: Mayuri Kawade
Duration: June 2025 – August 2025


1. Introduction
SecureDocShare is a secure document sharing web application that allows users to register, authenticate, and manage documents in a safe environment. The system provides secure login, personalized dashboards, and profile management features while ensuring that user data is protected. The platform integrates with Firebase for authentication and data storage.
Citizens will be able to keep documents such as mark sheets, PAN cards, passports, and other important documents in digital format as a result of this advancement. Simultaneously, it aims to cut government spending, lowering the government's overhead costs. It will lessen the risks of losing crucial documents by linking each member's Adhaar number, which is a unique number given to all cardholders. The internet system allows you to share them. Physical copies of documents will become obsolete in the near future. It will provide services in all main categories, including education, health care, railroads, and other specifics.


2. Objectives
* To create a secure and reliable platform for document sharing.
* To integrate user authentication and authorization using Firebase.
* To design a user-friendly interface for managing personal profiles and documents.
* To ensure responsive design for accessibility across devices.
* To log user activities for security monitoring and auditing purposes.


3. Tools & Technologies Used
* Frontend Languages: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6)
* Styling: CSS with responsive layouts (Flexbox, media queries)
* Backend/Integration: Firebase (Authentication, Firestore/Realtime DB, Hosting)
* Node.js & npm for project dependencies
* Development Tools: Visual Studio Code, GitHub (Version Control)


4. System Design

4.1 Frontend
• index.html: Landing page with login/register options.
• register.html: User registration page with form validation.
• dashboard.html: Personalized dashboard for managing shared documents.
• profile.html: Profile management interface.

4.2 Styling (CSS)
• style.css: General styling for index and registration pages.
• dashboard.css: Custom styles for dashboard layout and document management.
• profile.css: Profile customization and UI elements.

4.3 JavaScript Functionality
• auth.js: Handles authentication (login, logout, register).
• dashboard.js: Manages document interactions on the user dashboard.
• profile.js: Allows users to update their profile details.
• firebaseConfig.js: Contains Firebase project configuration for authentication and database.
• logger.js: Logs user activity for auditing and debugging.

4.4 Integration with Firebase
Firebase Authentication is used for secure login and registration. Firebase Firestore (or Realtime DB) is used for storing user profiles and document metadata. Firebase Hosting may be used to deploy the app. But here we are using Netlify. 


5. Key Features
* Secure user authentication and authorization.
* User registration and profile management.
* Personalized dashboard for managing shared documents.
* Activity logging using custom logger module.
* Responsive design accessible from desktop and mobile devices.
* Integration with Firebase backend services.


6. Challenges & Solutions
• Challenge: Implementing secure user authentication.
  - Solution: Integrated Firebase Authentication for robust login and signup.

• Challenge: Maintaining responsive UI across devices.
  - Solution: Used CSS Flexbox and media queries for adaptive layouts.

• Challenge: Logging user activities effectively.
  - Solution: Developed logger.js to record user events and errors.

• Challenge: Ensuring seamless integration with Firebase.
  - Solution: Used firebaseConfig.js for centralized configuration and modular JS files.


8. Conclusion
SecureDocShare successfully delivers a secure and user-friendly document sharing platform. By leveraging Firebase for authentication and storage, the project ensures data security and user privacy. The modular design enhances maintainability, and the responsive UI improves accessibility. This project strengthened my skills in authentication, client-server integration, and frontend development.


9. Future Enhancements
* Enable real-time document collaboration between users.
* Implement file encryption before uploading to the cloud.
* Introduce role-based access control (admin, editor, viewer).
* Add support for sharing documents via unique secure links.
* Integrate notifications (email or in-app) for document updates.
* Deploy full backend with Node.js/Express and database for extended functionality.
